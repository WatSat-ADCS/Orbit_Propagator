Just run orbit_comparison.m in MATLAB to compare the simulation results to the verification data. Alternatively, run from command line with:
	matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r 'orbit_comparison'

Note that this cript also runs the convert_simulation_data.m script. The inputs to the orbit_comparison.m script are the simulation and verification data file names (written directly in the script) and whatever input filenames written directly in the convert_simulation_data.m script.

Note that MATLAB typically has a difficult time reading in data from an .xlsx file, so it is preferable to take verification data from a .mat file.

Also, the orbit_comparison.m script apparently doesn't like it when you turn off java, so don't include the "-nojvm" flag when running it.


If you just want to convert the simulation data then just run the convert_simulation_data.m script in MATLAB, or from the terminal using:
	matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r 'convert_simulation_data; exit'

The input file names are just written directly in the script.
